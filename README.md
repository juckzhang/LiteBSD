LiteBSD
======

LiteBSD is a variant of 4.4BSD operating system adapted for microcontrollers.
Currently, only the Microchip PIC32MZ family is supported as a target.
It is equipped with MMU with paging support, and 512kbytes of on-chip RAM.
These resources are enough to build a compact networked embedded system.

For more information, see [LiteBSD Wiki pages](https://github.com/sergev/LiteBSD/wiki).

Precompiled binaries for several PIC32MZ boards are available from
[Autobuild Download page](http://litebsd.org/wiki/autobuild.php).
